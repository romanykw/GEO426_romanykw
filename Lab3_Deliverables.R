#Questions 

#1. What is the difference between the sf library and the terra library 

#2. There are some common spatial data manipulation functions (GIS shapefile manipulation functions) in the sf library. What are they and what do they do? 
  
#3. How would you create a new sf object representing a line or a polygon, given a set of coordinates? 
  
#4. How do you filter spatial data based on a specific attribute, such as area or population? 
  
#5. Suppose you have a dataset of weather stations and temperature readings. How would you visually represent areas of high and low temperatures on a map using R? 
  
#Your turn to code 

#1. Create your own mixed geometry type with point, line, and polygon geometry and apply a buffer 

#2. Create two polygons and perform an union that combines both of them 

#3. Create a mult-layer raster object and produce a jpg output (jpg output is not in the R code – you’ll have to google/Chat GPT how to use it) 

#4. The code provides a couple of ways to represent trees as a geographic phenomena. Please write code to represent trees in a different way. Be creative! 
  
#5. There are several examples of Choropleth maps that use different classification techniques. Please provide a Choropleth map of a variable in the Marriage Dataset that uses a sequential color scheme.
